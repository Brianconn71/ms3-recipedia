## Testing Recipedia

### Responsive Testing

Testing of the site was required for my milestone 3 project.

To test for responsiveness of my website. I used Chrome Dev Tools to test the site at the various screen resolutions.

My site was found to be mobile responsive on each screen resolution and is mobile responsive down to a screen resolution of 270px.

Below is a list of all of the screens that my site was tested on.

* Galaxy Fold

#### Result

* The search will return the result to the user with a message saying how many recipes are in the search if the search was successful and if not it will tell the user there are no searches based on the text entered in the search bar. If the user clicks enter without a search phrase then a prompt will ask them to please enter some characters into the search. When the filter button is clicked recipes of the relevant type will be displayed in paginated format.

## Issues and Bugs

### resolved Issues

* Some materialize form and input elements were not reacting to changes that I was making regardless of how well I targeted them, I used materialize documentation and google chrome tools to target these elements and I had to use the !important selector in some cases to overrule Materialize.

* I spent a huge amount of time trying to get the save buttons working and the logic behind them, I read lots of mongo documentation to find out the $push method which I then used to add a new field to the users db if a user saves a recipe, I got plenty of help from slack users Karen and Daisy to help with this part. Once I got that bit working I kept running into hey errors for users who were registered with the site but had not saved any recipes and thus had no saved_recipes field in there users record. The way that I managed to get around this was to use Try and except to only get the saved_recipes field from a user if they have a saved recipe in their araay in the users db and if they don't then don't show the saved recipes section of the profile page to the users. If the users selects to save a recipe then add that recipe id to an array in the uders db and if a user chooses to remove a saved recipe then the python code will remove the saved recipe id from the users db array.

* I struggled initially with pagination as it was something we were not taught but I got a lot of help from slack to understand it and eventually found a simple pagination example project on github that hugely helped me and I eventually got it to work with six items displayed on a page

* Delete confirmation modals in a for loop - caused me untold grief and pain. I got a lot of help from slack and in particular slack user Igor who helped me to understand data attributes and I eventually got the delete confirmation modal to work. 


### Bugs

Unfortunately, I ran out of time and know how to fix some bugs that remain.

* I could not get the chrome autofill color for the form inputs to match the color of the form, I tried every color and opacity that possibly could have worked but it just wouldn't look the same as the rest of the form background color, it made the text hard to see.

* I initially, had planned to use "input type="file"" as a way for users to upload images to their recipes, unfortunately I could not get this to work as for some reason the images didnt seem to get stored in the correct firld in the mongo database. This meant that I had to use "type=url" but unfrotunately I couldn't get the pattern for the input to accept .jpg and .png in the url I tried multiple patterns but I couldn't seem to get it to work the way I wanted so there is an issue that a user could enter any url into the add or edit recipe forms even urls not belonging to images and so cause that recipe to not display properly on the recipes page and with no image too. 

* When a user edits a recipe and adds a new recipe or step it gets labelled as step/ingredient 2 even if there are more than two ingredients or steps in the recipe. This is not ideal for users but in the backend it works perfectly and gets added into the bottom of the array and shown and numbered correctly on the site its just that label numbers may cause concern to a user.

* I had to manually enter the ids for the filter recipe buttons, I tried to use jinja templating to get the category name from the category database but unfortunately It would not work correctly so I had to manually add the ids to the get recipes html page.
