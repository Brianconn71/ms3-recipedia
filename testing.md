## Testing Recipedia

### Responsive Testing

Testing of the site was required for my milestone 3 project.

To test for responsiveness of my website. I used Chrome Dev Tools to test the site at the various screen resolutions.

My site was found to be mobile responsive on each screen resolution and is mobile responsive down to a screen resolution of 270px.

Below is a list of all of the screens that my site was tested on.

I also had family members and friends test out the site on their various devices/gadgets and it was responsive and acting as it should on each device used.

### Javascript Testing

The Javascript used in the site hads to pass validation with [jshint.com](https://jshint.com/). Below are images displaying the javascript files used in the project passing the javascript validation test.
